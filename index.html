        Hello! My name is Blaze, and this is my startup art commision website. I have been learning art seriously for the past 2 years. I am experienced in working with sketching, water colour, and I am hoping to go into digital art and colouring pencils. You will mainly find landscape, still life, and animal drawings but I hope that I will extend my art to people and portraits soon.
